        <h3><span>Mathematics</span></h3>
        <p>I graduated on Faculty of Mathematics - University of Belgrade. For many years I am teaching students Mathematics, Physics and Informatics, so far very successfully. I am a mathematician - a professional one, but I am not a professional programmer...yet (for some time I worked on B2B/B2C E-commerce implementation and Websites evaluation). I do some programming, but as freelancer. To common question "Do you have to be good at math to be a good programmer?" I'm going against the grain and saying yes, you need a math mindset or/and logical thinking, at least.</p>

        <h3><span>Programming</span></h3>
        <p> This year, I decided to upgrade my programming skill, although it is my profession. Educated at<a href="https://code.edu.rs/" target="_blank">CODE by COMTRADE</a>I became a Web Application Developer. My final exam consisted of: creating a database and building an application "Travel agency" in C# using data-base first approach. Technologies used: C#, ASP.NET, MVC, Entity framework, SQL, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap. I consider myself more as a back-end developer, but I also enjoy front-end programming. Also, I am still learning every day. </p>
